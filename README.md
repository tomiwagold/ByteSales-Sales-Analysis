# ByteSales-Sales-Analysis

**Project Overview:**

This project focuses on analyzing ByteSales’ transactional sales data using Power BI. The goal was to uncover trends in sales performance across products, stores, and customer demographics, and to provide actionable insights that can support strategic business decisions. The interactive dashboard offers a clean, visual representation of key sales metrics, making it easy to identify growth opportunities.

**Business Problem:**

ByteSales needed to understand which products, stores, and customer segments were driving the most revenue in order to improve decision-making in marketing, product distribution, and store management.

**Key Insights & Solutions:**

	1.	Sales Trends Over Time
	•	Insight: Sales showed consistent growth in the last quarter, with noticeable spikes during promotional periods.
	•	Solution: Plan more frequent promotions or campaigns during high-performing months to sustain momentum and boost quarterly targets.
	2.	Product Performance
	•	Insight: A few specific products consistently led in total sales, while others contributed minimally.
	•	Solution: Focus marketing and inventory efforts on best-selling products, and consider bundling or discounting underperforming items.
	3.	Category & Gender Analysis
	•	Insight: Certain product categories performed better among specific gender groups.
	•	Solution: Use this insight to tailor product recommendations and advertising—target male and female customers with category-specific campaigns.
	4.	Store-Level Performance
	•	Insight: Some stores and managers significantly outperformed others in sales volume.
	•	Solution: Investigate what high-performing stores are doing well and replicate those practices across lower-performing branches. Recognize top-performing managers to encourage motivation.
	5.	Customer Insights & AOV
	•	Insight: The average order value remained stable, but customer count varied across stores.
	•	Solution: Introduce loyalty programs or cross-sell opportunities to increase average order value, especially in stores with lower customer traffic.
